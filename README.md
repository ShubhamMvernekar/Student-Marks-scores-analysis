**A Data-Driven Approach to Analyzing Student Marks and Performance** 📊

Welcome to the **Student Marks & Scores Analysis** repository! This project focuses on analyzing student performance by examining their scores across various subjects. We dive into the data to extract useful insights, such as trends in performance, subject-wise analysis, and identifying key areas for improvement.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to:
- 📈 **Analyze the Distribution**: Understand the distribution of scores across students.
- 🔍 **Identify Performance Trends**: Discover trends in student performance over time.
- 🧑‍🏫 **Subject-wise Analysis**: Gain insights into how students perform in different subjects.
- 🎯 **Targeted Improvement**: Help educational institutions identify areas where students need improvement.

## 🧑‍💻 **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains information about:
- **Student ID**: Unique identifier for each student.
- **Subject**: The subject in which the student was assessed (e.g., Math, English, Science).
- **Marks**: The score the student achieved in that subject.
- **Total Marks**: The maximum possible marks for the subject.
- **Percentage**: The percentage score for each subject.

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations and plotting.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For running and displaying the analysis interactively.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and calculations.

## 🔧 **Installation**

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamMvernekar/Student-Marks-scores-analysis.git
   cd Student-Marks-scores-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Start exploring the analysis** in the provided Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📂 **Project Structure**

- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and guiding you through the steps.

## 🔍 **Key Insights & Analysis**

### 1. **Marks Distribution Analysis** 📊

Understanding the distribution of marks across all students helps identify patterns such as the overall class performance and how many students are achieving high or low marks.

#### Example Visualization: Marks Distribution
![Marks Distribution](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Marks+Distribution)  
*Histogram showing the distribution of student marks.*

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data/student_marks.csv')

# Plotting the distribution of marks
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(df['Marks'], bins=20, color='cornflowerblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Student Marks')
plt.xlabel('Marks')
plt.ylabel('Number of Students')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 2. **Subject-Wise Performance Analysis** 🎓

This analysis breaks down the students' performance by subject, helping us identify which subjects students tend to score the highest or lowest in.

#### Example Visualization: Subject-Wise Performance
![Subject Performance](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Subject+Performance)  
*Bar chart showing average marks in different subjects.*

#### Example Code:
```python
# Grouping the data by subject to calculate average marks per subject
subject_performance = df.groupby('Subject')['Marks'].mean()

# Plotting subject-wise performance
subject_performance.plot(kind='bar', color='lightseagreen', figsize=(10, 6), title='Average Marks in Different Subjects')
plt.xlabel('Subject')
plt.ylabel('Average Marks')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

### 3. **Performance Trend Over Time** ⏳

By analyzing how students' performance evolves over time, we can uncover trends like improvements or dips in class performance.

#### Example Visualization: Performance Trend Over Time
![Performance Trend](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Performance+Trend)  
*Line chart showing trends in student performance across different months/years.*

#### Example Code:
```python
# Grouping by Year to analyze performance trend
df['Year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']).dt.year
yearly_performance = df.groupby('Year')['Marks'].mean()

# Plotting the performance trend
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
yearly_performance.plot(kind='line', marker='o', color='tomato')
plt.title('Performance Trend Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Average Marks')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 4. **Student Performance vs Total Marks** 🏆

This analysis compares student performance against the total marks available, which can provide insights into the overall difficulty level of the subjects and how students are coping with them.

#### Example Visualization: Performance vs Total Marks
![Performance vs Total Marks](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Performance+vs+Total+Marks)  
*Scatter plot comparing individual student marks with the total marks for each subject.*

#### Example Code:
```python
# Scatter plot to compare marks vs total marks
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df['Marks'], df['Total Marks'], color='gold', edgecolors='black')
plt.title('Student Marks vs Total Marks')
plt.xlabel('Marks Obtained')
plt.ylabel('Total Marks')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
